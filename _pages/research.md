I am currently updating this section.

<h6><span class="font-weight-bold">Overview</span></h6>
In the last two years, I have mainly been working on Grothendieck-Verdier categories. These are monoidal categories with a duality structure that is more general than rigidity. Grothendieck-Verdier categories occur as representation categories of vertex operator algebras to which the Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang theory of tensor products applies. This has been my main motivation in studying them.

In progress.
