<h2>**Overview**</h2>
In the last two years, I have mainly been working on Grothendieck-Verdier categories. These are monoidal categories with a duality structure that is more general than rigidity. My main motivation in studying Grothendieck-Verdier categories has been their occurrence as representation categories of vertex operator algebras to which the Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang theory of tensor products applies.
