I am currently updating this section.

<h6><span class="font-weight-bold">Overview</span></h6>
In the last two years, I have mainly been working on Grothendieck-Verdier categories. These are monoidal categories with a duality structure that is more general than rigidity. Grothendieck-Verdier categories occur as representation categories of vertex operator algebras to which the Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang theory of tensor products applies. This has been my main motivation in studying them.

<h6><span class="font-weight-bold">Theses</span></h6>
- My [<ins>bachelor's thesis</ins>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13EyI9eTgfvTnlHWxnKYQZ2IcJ5FZeQFS/view?usp=sharing).

<h6><span class="font-weight-bold">Surface diagrams for Grothendieck-Verdier categories</span></h6>
This is a list of .HOM files relevant for my master's thesis. These are input-data for [<ins>homotopy.io</ins>], a web-based proof assistant for finitely-presented globular n-categories.

- The signature of <a href="/assets/pdf/LD-categories.hom" download="LD-categories.hom">linearly distributive categories</a>.
- The signature of <a href="/assets/pdf/LD-Frobenius_algebras.hom" download="LD-Frobenius_algebras.hom">LD-Frobenius algebras</a>.

To use them, import the downloaded files into the beta version of [<ins>homotopy.io</ins>](https://beta.homotopy.io). 

Some .STL files of surface diagrams from my master's thesis:

- The <a href="/assets/pdf/left_distributor.stl" download="left_distributor.stl">left distributor</a>.
- The <a href="/assets/pdf/right_distributor.stl" download="right_distributor.stl">right distributor</a>.
- Half of the <a href="/assets/pdf/Frobenius_relation-first_part.stl" download="Frobenius_relation1.stl">LD-Frobenius relation</a>.
- Other half of the <a href="/assets/pdf/Frobenius_relation-second_part.stl" download="Frobenius_relation2.stl">LD-Frobenius relation</a>.

Display your downloaded .STL files here:

The .STL files were created with homotopy.io. Unfortunately, the .STL file format does not support colours.
