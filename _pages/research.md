I am currently updating this section.

<h6><span class="font-weight-bold">Overview</span></h6>
In the last two years, I have mainly been working on Grothendieck-Verdier categories. These are monoidal categories with a duality structure that is more general than rigidity. Grothendieck-Verdier categories occur as representation categories of vertex operator algebras to which the Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang theory of tensor products applies. This has been my main motivation in studying them.

This is a list of homotopy.io files relevant for my master's thesis. Homotopy.io is a web-based proof assistant for finitely-presented globular n-categories. Open the files in [<ins>homotopy.io</ins>](https://beta.homotopy.io) after downloading:
