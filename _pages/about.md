I am a master's student in mathematics at the University of Hamburg. I am writing my thesis under the supervision of [Christoph Schweigert](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/schweigert/).

My mathematical research interests are in quantum algebra, quantum topology and in applications of higher category theory to representation theory.
