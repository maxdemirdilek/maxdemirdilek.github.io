I am a master's student in mathematics at the University of Hamburg. I am writing my thesis under the supervision of [<ins> Christoph Schweigert</ins>](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/schweigert/).

My mathematical research interests are in algebra, quantum topology and in applications of higher category theory to representation theory.

My [<ins> CV</ins>](assets/pdf/Demirdilek_CV.pdf).
